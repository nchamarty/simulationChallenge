## The Investment Game (Brief)

You have the opportunity to buy-in to this game next week with $30,000. Your job is to analyze the potential outcomes of the game and communicate why or why you should not buy-in to the game.  

Each year after buy-in you flip a fair coin:

- Heads: increase your account balance by 50%
- Tails: decrease your account balance by 40%

You play annually until age 75. Your mission is to analyze outcomes and communicate insights clearly.

My current age is 37, so the number of years I have to play annually until age of 75 is ** 38 years **. 

### Generative DAG Model (from the source challenge)

The following DAFT diagram shows the generative structure of the investment game over time.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

import daft

# Create the DAG directly without custom class
investmentDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=100, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial wealth (deterministic)
investmentDAG.add_node("W0", "Initial Wealth\n$W_0 = 30,000$", x=4, y=2.5, aspect=5.4, 
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes  
investmentDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=0, y=1, aspect=4, scale = 1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
investmentDAG.add_node("Wt", "\nWealth t\n$W_t = 1.5 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 1$\n$W_t = 0.6 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 0$\n", x=4, y=1, scale = 1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
investmentDAG.add_edge("W0", "Wt")
investmentDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Wt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
investmentDAG.add_plate([-2, 0.5, 7.8, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., N", shift=-0.1)
```

```

## Analysis Tasks (Fill These In)

### 1) Expected Value After 1 Flip

TODO: Explain whether the expected value of your account balance after one flip is >, =, or < $30,000. What is the gain in expected value as a percentage of your buy-in? Does this simple analysis suggest you should buy-in to the game?

```{python}
#| label: q1-expected-value-py
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Initial wealth
W0 = 30000

# Probabilities and outcomes
p_heads = 0.5
p_tails = 0.5

# Outcomes after 1 flip
W1_heads = W0 * 1.5  # Heads: increase by 50%
W1_tails = W0 * 0.6  # Tails: decrease by 40%

# Calculate Expected Value
E_W1 = p_heads * W1_heads + p_tails * W1_tails

# Calculate gain in expected value
gain = E_W1 - W0
gain_pct = (gain / W0) * 100

# Print results
print("="*70)
print("EXPECTED VALUE AFTER 1 FLIP")
print("="*70)
print(f"\nInitial wealth (W0):                    ${W0:,}")
print(f"\nPossible outcomes:")
print(f"  Heads (50%): W1 = 1.5 × ${W0:,} = ${W1_heads:,.2f}")
print(f"  Tails (50%): W1 = 0.6 × ${W0:,} = ${W1_tails:,.2f}")
print(f"\nExpected Value Calculation:")
print(f"  E[W1] = P(Heads) × W1_heads + P(Tails) × W1_tails")
print(f"  E[W1] = {p_heads} × ${W1_heads:,.2f} + {p_tails} × ${W1_tails:,.2f}")
print(f"  E[W1] = ${E_W1:,.2f}")
print(f"\nGain in expected value:                  ${gain:,.2f}")
print(f"Gain as % of buy-in:                      {gain_pct:.2f}%")
print("="*70)

# Create comparison dataframe
comparison = pd.DataFrame({
    'Metric': ['Initial Wealth (W0)', 'Expected Value E[W1]', 'Gain', 'Gain %'],
    'Value': [f'${W0:,}', f'${E_W1:,.2f}', f'${gain:,.2f}', f'{gain_pct:.2f}%']
})

comparison

```

**Analysis**: The expected value after one flip is **$31,500**, which is **greater than** the initial investment of $30,000. This represents a gain of **$1,500** or **5%** of the buy-in. 

The one-flip expected value is $31,500, which is $1,500 (5%) above the $30,000 buy-in. This suggests a positive expected return.
However, this analysis is limited:
It only considers one flip; over 38 years, variance and compounding matter.
The 40% loss on tails compounds over time, which can outweigh the positive expectation.
It ignores the risk of ruin or ending below the initial investment.


### 2) Single Simulation Over Time (Narrative + Plot)

Briefly narrate and visualize what happens to your account balance over the course of one run. Are you happy with the outcome? Why? or Why not?  You can use a time series plot to visualize the changes in your account balance over time.

```{python}
#| label: q2-single-sim-py
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Single simulation path of account balance"

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Initial wealth
W0 = 30000
years = 38

# Draw 38 coin flips (one per year)
coin_flips = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.5, size=years)

# Initialize wealth array (includes initial wealth at year 0)
wealth = np.zeros(years + 1)
wealth[0] = W0

# Calculate wealth over time
for i in range(years):
    if coin_flips[i] == 1:  # Heads: multiply by 1.5
        wealth[i + 1] = wealth[i] * 1.5
    else:  # Tails: multiply by 0.6
        wealth[i + 1] = wealth[i] * 0.6

# Create time array (years 0 to 38)
time = np.arange(years + 1)

# Print summary statistics
print(f"Initial wealth: ${wealth[0]:,.2f}")
print(f"Final wealth after {years} years: ${wealth[-1]:,.2f}")
print(f"Net change: ${wealth[-1] - wealth[0]:,.2f} ({(wealth[-1]/wealth[0] - 1)*100:+.2f}%)")
print(f"Number of heads: {np.sum(coin_flips)} out of {years} flips")
print(f"Number of tails: {years - np.sum(coin_flips)} out of {years} flips")

# Create matplotlib OO time-series plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,5))

# Plot the wealth over time
ax.plot(time, wealth, linewidth=2, color='steelblue', marker='o', markersize=4)

# Add horizontal line at initial investment
ax.axhline(y=W0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=1.5, 
           label=f'Initial Investment (${W0:,})', alpha=0.7)

# Formatting
ax.set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Account Balance ($)', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title(f'Single Simulation: Account Balance Over {years} Years', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3, linestyle='--')
ax.legend(fontsize=10)

# Format y-axis to show currency
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, p: f'${x:,.0f}'))

# Set x-axis to show integer years
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, years + 1, 5))
ax.set_xticklabels(np.arange(0, years + 1, 5))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
#### Interpretation of the above plot:
1. From the above time-series plot of single run every year, over a period of 38 years, the final winnings value is $259.36. This is a significant drop (~99%) than the initial buy-in value of $30,000.  

2. Number of heads from the simulation data shows 16 as opposed to 22 tails from total of 38 flips (1 each year) which explains more loss than gain in the winnings.

3. Based on above observations, it does not look like a profitable option to play the simulation over a period of 38 years (until the age of 75) 


### 3) 100 Simulations: Distribution of Final Balances

TODO: Visually and narratively describe the distribution of your account balance after running the 100 simulations. What is the probability of outcomes that you'd be happy with after having invested $30,000?

# To center $30,000, extend the same distance on the left
x_min = W0 - right_range
x_max = W0 + right_range
# If x_min would be negative, we can't go below 0

if x_min < 0:
    # For $30,000 to be centered: (x_min + x_max) / 2 = $30,000

    x_max = 2 * W0  # This ensures $30,000 is at the center: (0 + 60,000) / 2 = 30,000

    if max_final * 1.05 > x_max:

```
#### **Interpretation of above plot:**
1. The blue dashed line at $30,000 shows the initial investment, serves as a stark dividing line. 

2. The histogram is extremely right-skewed. Most simulated final balances land well below the initial $30,000, so the bulk of the bars sit to the left of that blue reference line. 

3. Only a small fraction of runs produce very large gains, which drags the mean up to about $57.5K, while the median sits near $4.1K. That large mean–median gap confirms the long right tail: a few big winners, many losers. 

4. The annotation showing P(final > $30,000) ≈ 0.22 means only about 22% of scenarios finish ahead, so the dominant outcome is a loss even though rare windfalls exist. 

5. Overall the plot signals high downside risk with infrequent, extreme upside.

### 4) Probability Balance > $30,000 at Age 75 (Original Game)

TODO: Report the probability estimate and interpret its practical meaning.

```{python}
#| label: q4-prob-original-py
#| echo: false

# --- Compute probability and print result ---
prob_above_initial = np.mean(final_balances > W0)
print(f"P(final > ${W0:,}) = {prob_above_initial:.3f}")
```

#### Result:  P(final>30,000) = 0.220
A probability of 22.0% means that if we were to undertake this strategy many times, we would, on average, end up with more than your initial $30,000 in only about 22 out of every 100 instances. This indicates a high chance of losing money or ending up with less than your starting money, highlighting the significant risk associated with betting all your capital each round.

### 5) Modified Strategy (Bet Exactly 25% Each Round)

Instead of having the full balance at risk with each coin flip, assume only 25% of your balance is gambled each year. Compare this to the original game. Which is riskier? Which has better upside?

#### Left Histogram (100% Bet Strategy):
1. This histogram shows a distribution heavily skewed towards the lower end of final balances. 

2. Most of the bars are colored red, indicating that a significant majority of the simulations resulted in a final balance below the initial $30,000 investment

3. The gray dotted line indicates initial investment of $30,000. The orange dashed line reeprsenting the **mean final balance $57,497.89** is considerably higher than the purple dashed line for the **median balance ($4,052.56)**. This wide gap between the mean and median indicates that while a few simulations might have yielded very high returns (pulling up the mean), the typical (median) outcome was quite low, and often a loss.

4. The probability of finishing above $30,000 is **0.220** which means that only about 22% of scenarios finish ahead, so the dominant outcome is a loss even though rare windfalls exist.

5. **Conclusion:** This distribution highlights the high risk and volatility of betting 100% of your wealth each round. Most scenarios ended poorly, with only a small chance of significant gains.

#### Right Histogram (25% Bet Strategy):

1. In contrast to 100% stratgey, this histogram plotted out of 25% bet strategy, displays a more spread-out and generally higher distribution of final balances. 

2. A larger portion of the bars are colored green, signifying that more simulations ended with a balance above the initial $30,000.

3. The gray dotted line indicates initial investment of $30,000. The orange dashed line reeprsenting the mean final balance  $53,804.33  and the median final balance $47,482.86 represented by purple dashed line  are much closer together. The mean and median final balances both are significantly higher than the initial investment. The median is also now above the initial investment. 

4. The probability of finishing above $30,000 is **0.700** which means that about 70% of scenarios finish ahead, so the dominant outcome is a gain even though rare losses exist.

5. **Conclusion:** This distribution demonstrates that by betting a fixed 25% of your wealth, the strategy offers a more favorable risk-reward profile over the long term. It leads to a higher probability of positive outcomes and a better overall wealth accumulation, with less extreme downside risk compared to the 100% betting approach.

### 6) Briefly Explain Your Findings From The Previous Step in Light of A Concept Known as the "Kelly Criterion"
 
What is the Kelly Criterion and how does it relate to the modified strategy?

The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets or investments to maximize the long-term growth rate of wealth. It suggests betting a fraction of one's current wealth, which is calculated based on the probability of winning and the ratio of potential gain to potential loss.

For our investment game where outcomes are multiplicative (wealth is multiplied by a factor), we use the multiplicative Kelly formula:

**f* = (p/a) - (q/b)**

Where:
- **f*** is the optimal fraction of wealth to bet
- **p** is the probability of winning = 0.5
- **q** is the probability of losing = 0.5  
- **a** is the loss multiplier = 0.6 (when tails, wealth becomes 0.6×)
- **b** is the win multiplier = 1.5 (when heads, wealth becomes 1.5×)

**Applying the Kelly Criterion to our scenario:**

f* = (0.5/0.6) - (0.5/1.5)
f* = 0.8333 - 0.3333
f* = **0.5** (or 50%)

**Interpretation:**

The Kelly Criterion suggests betting **50% of your wealth** on each round to maximize long-term growth. This aligns perfectly with our modified strategy analysis! 

**Key Findings:**

1. **The 50% bet strategy matches the Kelly-optimal fraction**, which explains why it performs so well compared to the 100% strategy. Our simulation results showing mean ≈ $98,586 and median ≈ $46,875 with a 50% bet strategy demonstrate the power of following Kelly's guidance.

2. **The 25% bet strategy (0.25 fractional Kelly)** is more conservative than the full Kelly recommendation. While it reduces volatility and provides a higher probability of finishing above the initial investment (70% vs 51% for 50% bet), it sacrifices some expected growth. This is a common approach called "fractional Kelly" used by risk-averse investors.

3. **The 100% bet strategy violates Kelly's principle** by betting more than the optimal fraction. This leads to excessive volatility and a high probability of ruin, as evidenced by our results showing only 22% of simulations finishing above $30,000 with a median of just $4,053.

4. **The Kelly Criterion explains the counterintuitive result**: Even though the expected value after one flip is positive ($31,500 > $30,000), betting 100% of wealth each round is suboptimal because the geometric mean (which determines long-term growth) is lower than the arithmetic mean when there's variance. The Kelly formula accounts for this by recommending a fraction that balances growth with risk.

**Conclusion:** Our simulation results validate the Kelly Criterion. The 50% betting strategy, which matches the Kelly-optimal fraction, provides the best balance of growth and risk management, while the 25% strategy offers a more conservative alternative for risk-averse investors.
